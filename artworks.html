                        <h3>Zander Vicente <br>"kien"</h3>
                        <p>This is the gift that I gave to him after our graduation recognition along with a letter. We are classmates in grade 9 and 10 but I only notice him in the second quarter of grade 10. During the second quarter, I ship him with mami Rics but my friends ship me with him after that they keep teasing me. Our teachers kept saying that he was cute and when I looked at him it was true so my little admiration grew. FF 3rd quarter were in the same group and same row, when we had a group project we always went to his house so my little admiration became bigger since I always saw him. He knows that I have a crush on me since its so obvious because my friends kept teasing me so I didn’t confess to him during that time. Ff end of 3rd quarter I confess he didn’t turn me down but he also didn’t say anything because of that I kept liking him thinking there would be a chance but I was wrong I think I’m just a safety net. Ff 4th quarter new seating arrangement I’m in the first row and he is in the last row, we don’t talk to each other anymore idk why. Ff before 4th quarter end I always go to my friend in the second row before them I always take pictures and so he can notice me. Ff 4th quarter recognition we are both in honors then we have a certificate after the event my friends asked him to take a picture with me holding our certificates. Ff year end party nothing happened. Ff graduation nothing happened. Ff graduation recognition we were both with honors with medals then my friend asked him again to take a picture with me after that I simply gave him my gift that was in a jar with sticky notes that have letter. Later that day his friend called teasing me about the letter I had written to him. I am so angry at him because he let them read it and I feel so embarrassed. I think joy controlled me too much, every time we chatted, I always gave it meaning and then I said to my friends that he’s full of mixed signals but the problem is me for giving his every message a meaning. I think we were never friends and never will be friends, we are just acquaintances. I still can't believe that in every photo taken at school we are always beside each other even in class picture. I still like him though and I will always be thankful to him for helping me with my research.</p>

                        <p>He is a grade 10 student in keris. He is part of SSG in keris and he is handsome and quiet. I first saw him when I was in grade 10 and he was in grade 9, he and his Partido went to our classroom and started to campaign and my eyes were only looking at him. Fast forward I’m in grade 11 and I just added him now on Facebook and instagram it took me a year just to add this guy. I’m shocked that his sister is my schoolmate at my university and she is also my schoolmate in elementary. I love his music taste and he is good at playing piano and guitar that’s why I started again to play my xylophone so he can notice me and it was a success. </p>
